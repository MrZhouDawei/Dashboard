IMPORTANT!!
https://v17.angular.io/guide/deployment#routed-apps-must-fallback-to-indexhtml

Make sure the "server" and not the application itself("angular") returns to "index.html" for page not found
since  when refreshing or editing manually the URL  the browser makes a request directly to the server and not
angular application by bypassing "route.ts".
